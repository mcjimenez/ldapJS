ldapJS
======

Client LDAP library for FirefoxOS

This will hold a complete, TCPSocket supported library implementing the LDAP V3 protocol (RFCs 4510, 4511, 4512 and 4513).

At this moment it doesn't hold much of anything, just an ASN.1 library (node version, taken from https://github.com/mcavage/node-asn1 ATM) which will also be ported to vanilla JS.
